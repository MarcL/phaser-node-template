# phaser-node-template
Starter Phaser JS projects using Node.js and Express to serve the files.

## Getting Started

Installing the server is simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcL/phaser-node-template
cd phaser-node-template
npm install
```

Then run it by using:
```
node .
```

By default it will on port 3000 but this can be changed by altering the `process.env.PORT`. Hit http://localhost:3000/index.html in a browser to serve a basic Phaser project.
